Description: This package is an implementation of the methods described in
     Steorts, R.C., Tancredi, A., Liseo, B. Generalized Bayesian Record
     Linkage and Regression with Exact Error Propagation, PSD (2018). The
     methods implemented in this package enable the user to recreate the
     experiments described in this paper, and allow for further
     experimentation with joint record linkage and linear regression tasks.
